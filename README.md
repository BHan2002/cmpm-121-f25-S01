# CMPM 121 Section Activity 01 - Bryce Han

This section activity is intended to introduce you to many of the tools and workflows that we'll use in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns.

Key tools:

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a cloud-based development environment based [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs in your web browser.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), a CI/CD service that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a static site hosting service that allows you to publish web content for free.

## Summary

Today we learned how to set up all the tools we will be using for posting assignments. Git, Deno, VSCode, etc.
We used some basic logic to increment the counter and change the color of said counter to a random non-white color.
Pretty good if I say so myself.
